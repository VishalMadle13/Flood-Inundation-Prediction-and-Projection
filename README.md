# JAL-DRISTHI
# Flood Prediction and Projection System

FIPPS is a Flood Inundation Prediction and Projection System. It is 
a **Theoretical** model to predict inundation. It blends data sources, geospatial analysis,
machine learning, and real-time data to predict and visualize flood extents accurately.
FIPPS improves flood preparedness, disaster management, and
public safety in flood-prone areas.
